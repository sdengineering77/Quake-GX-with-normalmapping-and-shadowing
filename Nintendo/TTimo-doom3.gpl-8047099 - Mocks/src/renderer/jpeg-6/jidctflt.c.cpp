 *
 * This file contains a floating-point implementation of the
 * inverse DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).  In the IJG code, this routine
 * must also perform dequantization of the input coefficients.
 *
 * This implementation should be more accurate than either of the integer
 * IDCT implementations.  However, it may not give the same results on all
 * machines because of differences in roundoff behavior.  Speed will depend
 * on the hardware's floating point capacity.
 *
 * A 2-D IDCT can be done by 1-D IDCT on each column followed by 1-D IDCT
 * on each row (or vice versa, but it's more convenient to emit a row at
 * a time).  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are much more
 * complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
 *
 * This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
 * scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
 * Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
 * JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
 * is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
 * While an 8-point DCT cannot be done in less than 11 multiplies, it is
 * possible to arrange the computation so that many of the multiplies are
 * simple scalings of the final outputs.  These multiplies can then be
 * folded into the multiplications or divisions by the JPEG quantization
 * table entries.  The AA&N method leaves only 5 multiplies and 29 adds
 * to be done in the DCT itself.
 * The primary disadvantage of this method is that with a fixed-point
 * implementation, accuracy is lost due to imprecise representation of the
 * scaled quantization values.  However, that problem does not arise if
 * we use floating point arithmetic.
