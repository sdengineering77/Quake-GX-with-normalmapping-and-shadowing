 *
 * This file contains a slow-but-accurate integer implementation of the
 * inverse DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).  In the IJG code, this routine
 * must also perform dequantization of the input coefficients.
 *
 * A 2-D IDCT can be done by 1-D IDCT on each column followed by 1-D IDCT
 * on each row (or vice versa, but it's more convenient to emit a row at
 * a time).  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are much more
 * complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
 *
 * This implementation is based on an algorithm described in
 *   C. Loeffler, A. Ligtenberg and G. Moschytz, "Practical Fast 1-D DCT
 *   Algorithms with 11 Multiplications", Proc. Int'l. Conf. on Acoustics,
 *   Speech, and Signal Processing 1989 (ICASSP '89), pp. 988-991.
 * The primary algorithm described there uses 11 multiplies and 29 adds.
 * We use their alternate method with 12 multiplies and 32 adds.
 * The advantage of this method is that no data path contains more than one
 * multiplication; this allows a very simple and accurate implementation in
 * scaled fixed-point arithmetic, with a minimal number of shifts.

/*
 * The poop on this scaling stuff is as follows:
 *
 * Each 1-D IDCT step produces outputs which are a factor of sqrt(N)
 * larger than the true IDCT outputs.  The final outputs are therefore
 * a factor of N larger than desired; since N=8 this can be cured by
 * a simple right shift at the end of the algorithm.  The advantage of
 * this arrangement is that we save two multiplications per 1-D IDCT,
 * because the y0 and y4 inputs need not be divided by sqrt(N).
 *
 * We have to do addition and subtraction of the integer inputs, which
 * is no problem, and multiplication by fractional constants, which is
 * a problem to do in integer arithmetic.  We multiply all the constants
 * by CONST_SCALE and convert them to integer constants (thus retaining
 * CONST_BITS bits of precision in the constants).  After doing a
 * multiplication we have to divide the product by CONST_SCALE, with proper
 * rounding, to produce the correct output.  This division can be done
 * cheaply as a right shift of CONST_BITS bits.  We postpone shifting
 * as long as possible so that partial sums can be added together with
 * full fractional precision.
 *
 * The outputs of the first pass are scaled up by PASS1_BITS bits so that
 * they are represented to better-than-integral precision.  These outputs
 * require BITS_IN_JSAMPLE + PASS1_BITS + 3 bits; this fits in a 16-bit word
 * with the recommended scaling.  (To scale up 12-bit sample data further, an
 * intermediate INT32 array would be needed.)
 *
 * To avoid overflow of the 32-bit intermediate results in pass 2, we must
 * have BITS_IN_JSAMPLE + CONST_BITS + PASS1_BITS <= 26.  Error analysis
 * shows that the values given below are the most effective.
