 * is executed per IDCT step, only during output pass setup.
 *
 * Note that the IDCT routines are responsible for performing coefficient
 * dequantization as well as the IDCT proper.  This module sets up the
 * dequantization multiplier table needed by the IDCT routine.

/*
 * The decompressor input side (jdinput.c) saves away the appropriate
 * quantization table for each component at the start of the first scan
 * involving that component.  (This is necessary in order to correctly
 * decode files that reuse Q-table slots.)
 * When we are ready to make an output pass, the saved Q-table is converted
 * to a multiplier table that will actually be used by the IDCT routine.
 * The multiplier table contents are IDCT-method-dependent.  To support
 * application changes in IDCT method between scans, we can remake the
 * multiplier tables if necessary.
 * In buffered-image mode, the first output pass may occur before any data
 * has been seen for some components, and thus before their Q-tables have
 * been saved away.  To handle this case, multiplier tables are preset
 * to zeroes; the result of the IDCT will be a neutral gray level.
